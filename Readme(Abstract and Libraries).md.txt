Abstract

The goal of this project is to create a dynamic biometric algorithm that can accurately confirm a person's physical presence by analyzing features including head length, eye blinking, iris tracking, head movements. If someone has problem in the eyes there is lips movement also. Although facial recognition software is readily available, 2D images or movies can trick it. On the other hand, dynamic biometric features provide ongoing authentication, access to more behavioral data, protection from spoofing attempts, and application in circumstances when other options are unfeasible.



The growing demand for digital security and the susceptibility of static biometric traits, such as fingerprints and facial features, to hacking and impersonation serve as the driving forces behind this initiative. This technology has the potential to improve security in a number of areas, including immigration services, military operations, and healthcare monitoring, by providing a trustworthy approach to evaluating physical appearance. In order to track iris and pupil motions and ascertain whether a person is physically present in front of a system, the proposed approach involves watching the movement of a ball on a screen. This project's overall goal is to use dynamic biometric features to enhance security and prevent unauthorized access to digital systems.
